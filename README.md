**DeepSeek-R1 MacOS Application**

This is simply an electron wrapper for the Website, as I prefer having a separate app when it comes to sites like this. I find it too difficult to manage it through browser tabs, and browser shortcut apps never work that well for me.

Download from the **Releases** tab and extract the .zip

Copy the .app to your Applications folder and run. It may not want to open due to security reasons, so you can bypass this by going to the bottom of the **Privacy & Security** section of your settings and allowing it.
